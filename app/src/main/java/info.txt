Stuff to do:

* Make AAMediaManager parcelable. Save the instance variables to a parcel so it can be used across
    changes to the UI (orientation changes, keyboard showing, etc).

To fix:
* Orientation issues - app crashes when the user moves the screen to another orientation.
    Orientation should be locked to portrait mode for the entire experience of the app.

Thoughts:

* Should the keys for albums/artists be by unique ID generated from the MediaStore, or the actual album
    names themselves?

Ideas:
* Allow the user to pick album art thumbnail size for the AlbumFragment listview?
